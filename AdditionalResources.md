The best place to find answers to your questions is Google. Though you will get quite a few results, programmers
typically trust
[stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) for their answers.
As this site is kept alive by programmers asking and answering questions, there is a very high likelihood that you will
find the answer to your question here.

## Git and GitHub

There are lots of tutorials and git documentation is great, although sometimes it can have some jargon to learn.

- The [Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf) has many common commands.
- The [main git starting point website](https://git-scm.com/).
- Some [on-line GitHub training](https://services.github.com/on-demand/).
