# Lists

## Create Python Lists

In Python a list is an ordered collection of elements of any type. To define a list, simply include a comma separated
list of elements between square brackets.

```python
numbers = [1, 20, 3, 40, 5, 60, 7, 80, 9]
print(numbers)  # prints the entire list on one line
```

Lists can be **heterogeneous**, allowing you to mix types at will.

```python
mix = [1, "cat", 3, "dog", 5, 6, 7, 8, "giraffe"]
print(mix)
```

## Access List Elements

Lists are indexed by numerical position, starting from **0**, and going to **number of elements - 1**. To access the
first element in the list:

```python
numbers = [1, 20, 3, 40, 5, 60, 7, 80, 9]
print(numbers[0])  # prints out just the first element
```

Lists may also be indexed from the end, using a **negative index**. To access the last element in the
list you may either use the index of the last element, or simply supply a negative index which counts
backwards from the end of the list.

```python
numbers = [1, 20, 3, 40, 5, 60, 7, 80, 9]

print(numbers[len(numbers) - 1])  # will output last element
print(numbers[-1])  # also prints out last element
```

### List Slicing

Lists can be easily sliced using the `[:]` operator, which returns a portion of a list as another list.

```python
numbers = [1, 20, 3, 40, 5, 60, 7, 80, 9]

print(numbers[:])  # will print the entire list
print(numbers[5:])  # will print from the 6th element to end of list
print(numbers[:5])  # will print from the first element up to but not including the 6th element
print(numbers[1:3])  # will print [ 20, 3 ]
print(numbers[9:10])  # will print [ ]
```

Slices can also be used to update the list.

```python
numbers = [1, 20, 3, 40, 5, 60, 7, 80, 9]

numbers[2:4] = [-3, -4]  # replace the elements starting at 
# 3rd location through 4th (up to but not including 5th)
# with the contents on right-hand side
print(numbers[:])  # prints [1, 20, -3, -4, 5, 60, 7, 80, 9]

# some more variations to try:
numbers[2:4] = [-3, -4, -5, -6, -7]
numbers[5:] = ['cat', 'dog', 100]
numbers[4:4] = ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

## Add/Remove List Elements

To add elements to the end of a list once it is constructed, use the `append(x)` function.

```python
mix = [1, "cat", 3, "dog", 5, 6, 7, 8, "giraffe"]

mix.append(10)
mix.append("lion")
print(mix)  # prints [1, 'cat', 3, 'dog', 5, 6, 7, 8, 'giraffe', 10, 'lion']
```

To remove elements from the list once it is constructed, use the `pop(x)` function. Without an argument, pop removes
the last element of the list.

```python
mix = [1, "cat", 3, "dog", 5, 6, 7, 8, "giraffe"]
mix.pop(0)  # removes the first element, returns 1
```

```python
mix.pop()  # removes the last element, returns "giraffe"
```

```python
print(mix)  # prints ['cat', 3, 'dog', 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

To insert elements in a list at a specific location, use the function `insert(n, value)`. Continuing with list "
mix":

```python
mix.insert(0, "front of list")  # inserts element at index 0
print(mix)  # prints ['front of list', 'cat', 3, 'dog', 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

### Exercise

Create a new Python file, `play-with-lists.py`. Copy the above code into the new file and run it to see if you get the
same results.
