# Simple Plotting

Now that we have loaded the weather data, let's create a few plots. There are many plotting packages available.
Here we are going to use the [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) package to create some plots.

## Using matplotlib and datetime

Before we can use the matplotlib and datetime libraries, we must import them. The as statement gives us a shorthand way
to refer to the library in our functions.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import datetime
```

## Simple X, Y Plot

To create an X, Y plot, the arrays of the X and Y values are simply passed to the `plot()` function. We want to plot
the average temperature (TAVG) for a given division over time.

Below we define a function called `plot_tavg` which takes the 2 arguments which are the X and Y arrays passed to the
`plot` function

```python
def plot_tavg(array_yearmonth, array_tavg):
    plt.plot(array_yearmonth, array_tavg)
    plt.title('Average Temperature')
    plt.show()
```

The `matplotlib.pyplot` library contains many [functions](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/api/pyplot_summary.html) for
plotting different kinds of
plots (line, bar, contours) and for styling the plots with a title or different colors. In the example, we create a
simple line plot and provide a title. If desired, you can pass additional options to the ```plot``
function to specify marks rather than lines, as well as the style and color of the lines or markers.

Finally, the `show()` function is called to display the resulting plot (shown below). The plot is displayed in a
modal dialog so your program will wait until you close the plot window before continuing execution.

Before calling the `plot_tavg` function, the data from the map must be placed into arrays. Recall that our data
loaded with load_data_objects_into_map will have a dictionary by division and then an array of the data for that
division. We need to extract the values for the average temperature into an array. Since we may want to create many
different plots for different types of data, we create a reusable utility where we will say which element of the
dictionary in the arrays we want to get.

This function, create_attribute_array, will loop through the array for a division (passed in as data) and extract each
individual value. The key to the values will be passed in as attribute. We'll put the values into a new array called a
that we return.

```python
# Extract attribute from dictionary as an array
def create_attribute_array(data, attribute):
    a = []
    for x in data:
        a.append(x[attribute])
    return a
```

So we can call it like this:

```python
data_5 = data['5']  # to get the 5th division
arr_date = create_attribute_array(data_5, 'YearMonth')
arr_tavg = create_attribute_array(data_5, 'TAVG')
arr_pcp = create_attribute_array(data_5, 'PCP')
```

### Exercise

Add the `import` statement to the top of your `read_weather.py` file.
Add the `plot_tavg` function to the file.
Add the `create_attribute_array` function to the file.
Update your `main` section to

1) Select one of the divisions from the data map.
2) Create attribute array objects for the YearMonth attribute and the TAVG attribute.
3) Call the plot_tavg function with the YearMonth as first input and TAVG as second.

The plot shown above is for division 10.

Modify your program to plot precipitation (PCP) instead of average temperature (TAVG).
Make your plot function more general by adding the title as an additional argument.

## Multiple sub-plots

Often it is useful to plot several plots together. Below two subplots are created, one for Average Temperature and
another for Precipitation.

```python
def plot_division(division_data):
    array__division = create_attribute_array(division_data, 'Division')
    array_yearmonth = create_attribute_array(division_data, 'YearMonth')
    array_tavg = create_attribute_array(division_data, 'TAVG')
    array_pcp = create_attribute_array(division_data, 'PCP')

    plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)
    plt.plot(array_yearmonth, array_tavg, 'ko-')
    plt.title('Division ' + str(array__division[0]))
    plt.ylabel('TAVG (F)')

    plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)
    plt.plot(array_yearmonth, array_pcp, 'r.-')
    plt.xlabel('array_YEARMONTH')
    plt.ylabel('PCP')

    plt.show()
```

### Exercise

Add the plot_division function to the file.
Update your main section to call the plot_division function instead of create_attribute_array and plot_tavg.

### Exercise

Modify your program to plot your temperature data in Celsius units instead of Fahrenheit.
