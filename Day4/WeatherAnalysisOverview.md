# Weather Analysis

## Overview

For this exercise, we will create a program that will do the following:

- Read in weather data from a CSV file.
- Perform analysis on the data.
- Display both data and results as visually appealing plots.

Along the way, we will leverage the Python concepts you have learned so far and introduce some new ones:

- Functions for temperature conversion
- Importing modules for plotting charts
- Reading data from CSV files

When we are done, you should have a file similar to the one in the examples/weather
folder: [weather_analysis.py](../examples/weather/weather_analysis.py).

## Weather Data

The weather data we will use for this exercise has been obtained
[NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/)

Our data file contains [divisional](https://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/CDO/CDODivisionalSelect.jsp#) data for the state of New
York from January 2001 through April 2017.

[Right click and save this link to download a copy of the CSV file to your computer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GRC-SummerSchool/learn-python/master/examples/weather/nystate_climate_indices_2010_2017.csv)

The CSV file contains the following columns with a header:

| Header    | Description                            |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| StateCode | State code                             |
| Division  | Division or station code (1-10)        |
| YearMonth | Year month timestamp e.g., 201001      |
| PCP       | Precipitation Index                    |
| TAVG      | Temperature Index                      |
| TMIN      | Minimum Temperature Index              |
| TMAX      | Maximum Temperature Index              |
| PDSI      | Palmer Drought Severity Index          |
| PHDI      | Palmer Hydrological Drought Index      |
| ZNDX      | Palmer Z-Index                         |
| PMDI      | Modified Palmer Drought Severity Index |
| CDD       | Cooling Degree Days                    |
| HDD       | Heating Degree Days                    |
| SPnn      | Standard Precipitation Index           |
