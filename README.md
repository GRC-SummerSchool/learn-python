# GRC-SummerSchool Learn Python.

This course is designed to provide an introduction to programming using Python. The 
course is geared toward folks with a scientific background and is structured to be 
completed in approximately four 45 minute sessions.

Over the four sessions, the class will build from the basics of the Python
language to using more advanced modules capable of plotting and analyzing 
data.

## Day 1

On the first day, the class will setup a Python environment on your laptop
and cover the basics of the Python language.

3. [Quick Intro to Python](Day1/PythonIntro.md)
4. [Hello World](Day1/HelloWorld.md)
5. [Python Specifics](Day1/Whitespace.md)
6. [Variables](Day1/Variables.md)
7. [Input](Day1/Input.md)
8. [Lists](Day1/Lists.md)

3. [Modules](Day3/Modules.md)
4. File I/O: [CSV Files](Day3/CSVFiles.md)
5. [Simple Plotting](Day3/SimplePlotting.md)

## Day 4

On the fourth day, previous topics will be combined to build a simple 
analytic for processing data and displaying the results.

1. [Git - Collaborating](Day4/GitBranch.md)
2. [Data Analysis](Day4/DataAnalysis.md)
