This course is designed to provide an introduction to programming using Python. The 
course is geared toward folks with a scientific background and is structured to be 
completed in approximately four 45 minute sessions.

Over the four sessions, the class will build from the basics of the Python
language to using more advanced modules capable of plotting and analyzing 
data.

## Day 1
