# GRC-SummerSchool Learn Python

This course is designed to provide an introduction to programming using Python. The
course is geared toward folks with a scientific background and is structured to be
completed in approximately four 45-minute sessions.

Over the four sessions, the class will build from the basics of the Python
language to using more advanced modules capable of plotting and analyzing
data.

## Day 1

On the first day, the class will set up a Python environment on your laptop
and cover the basics of the Python language.

1. [Setup Environment](Day1/Setup.md)
2. [Session Objectives](Day1/SessionObjectives.md)
3. [Quick Intro to Python](Day1/PythonIntro.md)
4. [Hello World](Day1/HelloWorld.md)
5. [Python Editing](Day1/PythonEditing.md)
6. [Variables](Day1/Variables.md)
7. [Expressions](Day1/Expressions.md)
8. [Input](Day1/Input.md)

## Day 2

On the second day, the class will introduce looping and an additional data
structure. More advanced features of the development environment will be shown.

1. [Lists](Day2/Lists.md)
2. [Conditionals](Day2/Conditionals.md)
3. [Loops](Day2/Loops.md)
4. [Dictionaries](Day2/Dictionaries.md)

## Day 3

3. [Modules & Packages](Day3/Modules.md)
4. [Software Testing](Day3/Testing.md)

## Day 4

On the fourth day, more advanced operations will be covered allowing for reading
data files and generating plots. All the previous topics will be combined to build a simple
analytic for processing data and displaying the results.

1. [Source Code Management](Day4/GitOverview.md)
2. [Weather Analysis Overview](Day4/WeatherAnalysisOverview.md)
3. [File I/O](Day4/CSVFiles.md)
4. [Simple Plotting](Day4/SimplePlotting.md)

## Extra material
